			Yknow, it's a pity that this time of year is so busy. We've been getting a lot of snow here in Michigan - not that heavy crappy wet snow that sucks but that light fanciful snow we all tend to enjoy at the outset of winter. I would love to spend some time just standing outside, quietly contemplating things, exploring that inner sombre nature deep inside that takes such odd delight in the muffling solitude brought on by the fall of a myriad of icy crystals, to just stand quietly and let my mind drift with the flowing air...
			</p>
			<p>
			yeah, not a chance this month :P
			</p>
			<p>
			As usual, i make decisions that make my life more difficult as opposed to easier. The past few comics sure we a challenge for the artistically challenged me... but i think i almost pulled them off. If nothing else, it was a fun and interesting experiment :) In the old days, i used to totally and completely avoid showing action scenes as much as possible. Now i'm finding that in a kind of masochistic way i actually enjoy the challenge of trying them, even if the outcome isn't always... very good. :P Hopefully the sequences of the past few comics, with Largo, and Miho and Ping and yuki make some sort of bizzare sense - they do to me, and seem to to most people i talk to, but they could all be just being nice to me :P

		So what have I been doing for the past week? Well, I have a pretty big trip to Southern California coming up, so I've been getting ready for that. But procrastination being what it is, I'm doing a lot of other things, from making sure I can pay my Animal Crossing mortgage (which is difficult when that darn Tom Nook has closed twice to renovate) to doing some writing for Newtype while poking about for more gigs (oh, hey, it's December, my interview with KOTOKO ran in the December issue, I should make sure to plug that a few more times).
		</p>
		<p>
		But anyway, what this rant is really about is my moment of self-conscious zen on Thursday night.
		</p>
		<p>
		See, on Thursday night I was idly browsing the Wikipedia looking up random subjects for kicks while playing some To Heart 2, which finally got to me from my bud Seiya. Then, I got an AIM message from Suberunker, who told me to fire up Animal Crossing DS so he could visit my town and give me apples to plant.
		</p>
		<p>
		After I opened my gates, Hodge-Podge sent me a panicked message, since he was at work late, and had been planning to play some Magic during his break. But he'd accidentally joined a timed tournament instead of a leisurely league, so he asked that I take over for him, which I gladly did, eventually going 3-0-2 and making top 8. Around then, Fred and I started discussing MT a bit, too...
