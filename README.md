## Why use Xcomic?

Xcomic is great for any artist seeking a solution to effectively and easily
publish his or her comics or manga on the internet. The artist takes care of
the images, while Xcomic provides a means to organize and display the series to
a large audience. Xcomic is extremely easy to use with a control panel for
posting comics and news. Comic display is also easy to customize. Pages are
fully XHTML compliant and their "look" can be changed using CSS styles.
Finally, Xcomic is free, open source, and easy to modify for your own use.
